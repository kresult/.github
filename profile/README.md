**An opinionated, functional Result type for Kotlin**

KResult is a functional library that provides an opinionated and feature-rich extension / alternative to Kotlin's Result<T> type. While the core library is as lean and dependency-free as possible, seamless integrations with common frameworks are provided via integration packages or plugins. KResult is heavily inspired by Scala's Try[T] type, Rust's Result<T, E> and Arrow's Either<A, B>.
